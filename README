A WordPress widget for displaying the most recent twitter status updates for a particular user or users.

At the moment, requires the WordpressZero library to be loaded in your theme: https://github.com/ggilder/wordpress_zero

To-do list:

Caching:
- Throttle API requests and use the cache if it's recent
	(This means we have to reset the cache when options are changed, too)

Processing & General:
- Use Twitter API's entities instead of parsing them ourselves (http://dev.twitter.com/pages/tweet_entities)
