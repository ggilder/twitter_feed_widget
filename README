A WordPress widget for displaying the most recent twitter status updates for a particular user or users.

At the moment, requires the WordpressZero library to be loaded in your theme: https://github.com/ggilder/wordpress_zero

Still need to implement tweet sorting for multi-user, and making cache option work per-instance instead of shared globally.
